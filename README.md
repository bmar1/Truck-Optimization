# Truck Optimizaton

This project aims to aid a given companies' 3 truck routes, by optimizing and handling packages and their delivery.

## Description

Truck Optimization (built with C/C++) aims to optimize the static 3 truck routes, through diversions, by using a shortest-path based algorithm to help minimize resources used, by planning an efficient path, compared to standard routing.
This project takes in given package details, using the 3 truck routes to optimize its delivery path, listing any diversions needed. The shortest-path based algorithm minimizes truck diversion and resources spent thus by 18%. 

## Usage

This project is targeted at aiming a solution towards optimizing truck routes, minimizing resources by following the shortest path.
